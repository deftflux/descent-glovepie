The purpose of this script is to help you assign game functions to the virtual
joystick axes and buttons in Descent.  Some gamepads may already have some
support in Descent, so when you try to assign them in Descent, the game may 
pick up the real gamepad input instead of the virtual one.

When using this script, you can use keystrokes on the keyboard to activate the
various buttons and axes on the virtual joystick in order to assign them in the
game.  Here are the keystrokes to use:


Keystroke  Virtual Joystick
---------------------------
Ctrl-1     Button 1
Ctrl-2     Button 2
etc.

Alt-1      Axis 1
Alt-2      Axis 2
etc.
