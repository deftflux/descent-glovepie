# DEPRECATED

This project is deprecated for the following reasons:

- GlovePIE is dead; its web site disappeared years ago now.
- PPJoy has a long-standing issue of requiring the installation of an unsigned driver, which is a security issue in Windows.  Further, the author has abandoned the project.
- An open-source alternative to GlovePIE called [FreePIE](http://andersmalmgren.github.io/FreePIE/) is now available, although it does not support as many controllers as GlovePIE yet.
- An open-source alternative to PPJoy called [vJoy](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vjoystick/) is now available, and it is released with a signed driver.
- I have developed an alternative on Windows called [JsPie](https://github.com/deftflux/JsPie) which supports the PS3 and XBOX controllers and outputs to vJoy.
- I have also developed an alternative on Linux called [ps3pie](https://github.com/deftflux/ps3pie).
